an interface between computer hardware and user.

Components of an Operating Systems:
There are two basic components of an Operating System.
- Shell is the outermost layer of the Operating System and it handles the interaction with the user. It interprets input for the OS and handles the output from the OS.
- Kernel is the core component of operating system. The kernel is the primary interface between the Operating system and Hardware.

Linux operating system:
- Linux is free and open-source, accessible to everyone.
- Its source code can be inspected and modified by anyone.
- This promotes global collaboration and innovation.
- Linux offers efficient performance and strong security.
- It works well across many devices and industries.

---CLI (Command-Line Interface)

What it is: A text-based interface where you type commands.

How it looks: A black/white terminal screen (like when you use Linux commands).

Examples:

ls → list files

cd /home → change directory

rm file.txt → remove a file

-Pros:

Very powerful and precise.

Uses fewer system resources (lightweight).

Can be automated with scripts.

-Cons:

Steeper learning curve.

You need to remember commands and syntax.

---GUI (Graphical User Interface)

What it is: A visual interface with windows, icons, menus, and buttons.

How it looks: Like Windows desktop, Ubuntu Desktop, macOS — you use a mouse and keyboard.

Examples:

Clicking folders in File Explorer instead of using ls.

Using Google Chrome browser instead of typing curl or wget.

Managing files with drag-and-drop.

-Pros:

Easier for beginners.

Intuitive and user-friendly.

Good for tasks that are visual (editing images, browsing).

-Cons:

Consumes more memory and CPU.

Less efficient for automation and repetitive tasks.

---Simple Analogy

CLI = Talking to the computer in its own language (commands).

GUI = Pointing and clicking to tell the computer what you want.
